Wacky maps with code

Some mappy things I've made with d3

# 1981

Using Project Linework and d3, I randomly shuffle the countries and apply a random color or hatching

# btv

Using Microsoft's building footprint GeoJSON around Burlington VT, I added buttons to randomly rotate the polygons and apply a random color scheme or hatching.

# Installing

None. Just download the repository and open the index.html

I only have a `package.json` because I use `xo` for javascript linting.
